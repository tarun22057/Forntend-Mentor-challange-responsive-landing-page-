# firstproject

My first big project (or as I like to call it) used HTML and CSS to clone a simple website
After learning a bit from different resourses and building some mini projects for learning different stuff
I decided to build a medium project. I found this challanenge on front-end practice and tried to replicate it as much as i can( couldn't do it exactly)
learned a lot of stuff while building this .
Tried to keep the code clean and structured but it is a total mess I know.
I learned to see how the website is structured at different sreen sizes before writting the HTML and try to give the similiar stuff same class names
inorder to style them once.
Also I learned how to use media queries.
For future I would start with analysing the structure of the website first before writing the HTML and would try to write clean CSS
(here my CSS is all over the place).
